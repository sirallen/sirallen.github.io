Welcome to my new blog and personal site! My name is Allen Sirolly. I recently finished a two-year stint as an RA at the Richmond Fed and am currently looking for work as a data scientist.

I have a BA in Mathematical Economics from the Unviersity of Pennsylvania, with hard-earned minors in Statistics and Political Science. I'm broadly interested in data science, economics, and U.S. and Chinese current affairs. I try to keep tabs on all of these things and more on Twitter, where you can find me [@Sirallenrolly](https://twitter.com/Sirallenrolly).

When I'm not programming or studying, I'm usually at the golf course working to sharpen my game. Ping me if you want to tee it up!
